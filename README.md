Ouroboros
========

Goal:
"Given an instance of Fedora Commons and Apache Solr, and a front-end interface capable of communicating with an HTTP / JSON API, the goal of this middleware is to be capable of ingesting objects, managing their preservation, and providing access, with minimal configuration to the applications it glues together. It does this by imposing descriptive and structural conventions for objects, and chaining disparate tasks together in a way that effectively unites these content-agnostic systems."
