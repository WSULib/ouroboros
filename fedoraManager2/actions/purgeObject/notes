Idea here will be to use RDF querying for objects with state = "Deleted"
<info:fedora/fedora-system:FedoraObject-3.0> <info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#state> <info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#Active> .

- Will probably need some kind of pruning, maybe use datatables?
	- at LEAST print out the PIDs...
- Consider two-key authentication from two users...
- Purge with optional backup!
