## Folders
###bag_classes###
This folder contains python classes used during ingest to create bags.  These classes are dropped in during the `ingestWorkspace()` workflow, after a job has been created, the metadata parsed, and the intellectual objects inserted into MySQL.  These classes might be applicable across collections, but might also be collection specific.
